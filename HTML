<h4> Why coding</h4>
<p>Coding is something that Iâ€™ve always wanted to learn therefore am very excited.Coding is something that could be very usefull for my future. The reason I chose this course is also to challenge myself and get out of my comfort zone since it has always been intresting to me.In this semester we did a GitHub profile and this is my first website.

<h3>My summer</h3>
<p> This summer, I visited Congo for the first time. I visited the capital which is called Kinshasa. I think the trip was amazing and unforgettable. I had the opportunity to get to know my culture on a deeper level and I met my family which was wonderful. I think Congo is a very beautiful and rich country and I hope to go again in the near future.
